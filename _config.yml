    content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
        Beyond coding, I find joy in various facets of life. I like gaming, watching anime and movies. When I'm not immersed in virtual reality, you can find me trying dishes in local restaurants and skateboarding in parks. Nature is my passion, I enjoy being in forests or near seas.
        Also sometimes I like to try something new like sewing, modeling, hiking on mountains and so one :)
